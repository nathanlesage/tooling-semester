# Presentations with Markdown and Reveal.JS

_by Hendrik Erz, Germany_

> This block builds upon basic knowledge of Markdown and Pandoc in order to create fully-compatible presentations in HTML-format by using the popular reveal.js-framework. It leverages the benefits of the Pandoc document converter in order to easily create presentations that run anywhere and do not require special software except a web browser.

## Preconditions

This course assumes that the learners already know the standard Markdown syntax and also have a very basic understanding of what HTML is. They should also know how to use Pandoc.
