# Block-Courses

> A fully customizable OER semester for teaching academic publishing, writing and working effectively with your computer — aimed at researchers in the arts & humanities.

## What is this?

This repository contains so-called Open Educational Resources aimed at enabling you, the users, to teach courses on academic publishing. It has been envisioned by a transnational working group aiming to improve the working conditions and habits of researchers around the world. The repository contains folders with material that you can use for teaching courses. Each single block (or, module) is designed to fill 90 minutes, as this is a common timeframe for teaching at universities. You can combine each of these blocks in order to arrive at a full semester's worth of teaching material. The block-format ensures that you can take into account the abilities and needs of your learners, as you, as a teacher, are best suited to estimate what your students expect and can deliver.

## Why and when should you use it?

Whenever you want to teach a course on academic writing, publishing, and related topics, you can use materials from this repository. The blocks are designed to be modular, so if you have twelve sessions à 90 minutes, you can use twelve of the blocks available here and order them as you wish. Of course, you can also design your own ones and contribute to this course material!

## How does it work?

If you are preparing a course -- be it a weekend-workshop or a course stretched over the course of a semester, first think about what you want to achieve with your course. Then, browse the available categories on this repository and download the folders to your computer. You can rename them in order to sort them, and adapt all materials in these folders until they suit your requirements.

Most course blocks should provide you with enough material to fill 90 minutes, even including some tasks for your students. Depending on the block, the contents may differ, but they should give you a perfect head-start for your course to ensure your students learn a lot and you can make use of freely available materials from your peers. For more information on the course block folders' structure, please consult the [contract](./CONTRACT.md).

## Contributing

We strive to enable learners across the global to excel in digital writing methods, and therefore warmly welcome contributions from each and every teacher here. If you have already held a course on academic publishing/writing, or have ideas on certain modules, feel free to submit them to this repository! Please read the [contract](./CONTRACT.md), which includes detailed instructions on the structure of course blocks, in order to enable other people to use your materials easily.
